OpenCharas is an open source character creator, aimed at RPGs, and comes with several both created and ripped sprites.

It uses a layer-based system that lets you create a character by composing different images in different layers; this allows for easy customization, quick duplication and tools for helping game makers put together characters and character sheets.

It is loosely based off of the RPG Maker 2000 Charas and Charas.EX projects.
